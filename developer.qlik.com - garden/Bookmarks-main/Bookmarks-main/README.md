# Bookmarks

This extension is a drop-down that dynamically populates with all the bookmarks inside a Qlik environment for the current user. The current format of the dropdown is "[App Name] - [Bookmark Name]". I would like to add more functionality to the extension and create groupings in the future. Please comment with ideas for development.
