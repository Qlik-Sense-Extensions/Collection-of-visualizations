![QSight Lineage Extension](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mydgd/QSight-Lineage/main/qsight-lineage-flow.png)

This extension visualizes data load script of Qlik Sense as a flow chart. 
It is very easy to use, just drag and drop extension into your Qlik Sense application and it will automatically parse all the parts of script and create the visualization. It is not perfect, it has some bugs, it doesnâ€™t understand everything but you know what they say; perfect is the enemy of good. 

1. [Download the Extension](https://github.com/mydgd/QSight-Lineage/raw/main/qsight-lineage.zip)
2. Install on Qlik Sense
3. Drag and Drop Extension into any Qlik Sense Application.

That is all! It will automatically parse the script and create the lineage with a nice	 flow chart.
