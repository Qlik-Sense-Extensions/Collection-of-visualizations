# CentralityX
Network Diagram with Centrality Measures for Qlik Sense

Built on D3.js V.4 with JSNetworkX (Javascript implementation of NetworkX).

## Description: 

Centrality Measures are well established network analysis algorithms that tell us how about the relationships in a network.
A Network is simply a group of Nodes associated together.
Nodes are simply entities, similar to Nouns in the English Language
Nodes are connected together via Edges.
Edges are simply the relationships between Nodes, similar to Verbs in the English Language.

## Why?:

Network Diagrams with Centrality Measures can quickly show us all the Entities and how they Entities are associated to other Entities together with the association relationship, the importance of each Entity and the strength of the relationships between entities.
